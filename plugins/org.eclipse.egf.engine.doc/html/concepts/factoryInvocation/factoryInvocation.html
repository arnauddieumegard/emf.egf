<h1 class="Head">Factory invocation</h1>

<a name="definition"><h2>Definition</h2></a>
<p class="Para">A factory invocation is a step of a production plan which invokes either a factory component or Java task. Expected parameters for the invocation are provided by the contract element of the factory component or by the context of the invocation.</p>

  
<a name="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2></a>
<p class="Para"> Generation tailoring depends on i) the viewpoint contents, and ii) on the parameter values given to a factory component's contract. A factory component invocation meets the second point. In the context of a production plan, an invocation is an orchestration step which realizes the connection from a requester factory component to the provider factory component; the context provides values expected by the factory component's contract.</p>

<p class="Para">To generalize this definition, a factory component or java task represents a function for a factory invocation. For instance, it could be a generation function (e.g., code, model generation, a generation function specialized by patterns), or a deployment function. An invocation FCI corresponds to a function f ensured by a factory component or Java Task and a list of parameters p required by f.</p>
<p class="Para">FCI: f (p)</p>

<p class="Para">FCI is a reflective structure because f can contain a new set of FCI; n is the depth level.</p>
<p class="Para">FCIn: fn (pn)</p>

<p class="Para">Creating an factory component invocation corresponds to the creation of a new FCI function. Executing a factory component corresponds to the application of FCI (b-reduction in lambda calculus).</p>

<a name="structure"><h2>Structure</h2></a>

<p class="Para">For an asset production with factory component, a factory invocation references a factory component. For an asset production with java task, an factory invocation contains a java task which references a java task factory. In the two cases, the factory invocation contains a context for passing parameter values. The relationship between a factory invocation and a factory component through a contract is explained in the contract section.</p>
